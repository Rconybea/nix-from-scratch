1. To find [nixpkgs.foo], look in
   [nixpkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix]
2. add to ./TOWER
3. add (+build) foo-nixpkgs to nxfspkgs.nix.  Proves that you know deps.  May have to skip if it's hard.
4. add to nixpkgs overlay in nxfspkgs.nix.   This will look cleaner, but obscures deps
   (since everything gets to pull anything it wants from nixpkgs)

Hoping that at some point we get enough stuff into nixpkgs-with-overlay, that things after that work out-of-the-box.
I think this is a matter of replacing all the entry points that cause nixpkgs to reach for stdenv/linux/default.nix,
that somehow aren't getting replaced by our overlay.
