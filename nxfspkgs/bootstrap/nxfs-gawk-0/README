We do not need awk to demo an working in-store compiler.
However, we need awk to run an autotools configure script.

1. PATH should contain
     ~/nixroot/bin

2. ensure PREFIX dir exists
     $ mkdir -p ./awk

3. build in stage0
     $ (cd stage0 && make compile && make install)

4. copy subtree into store
     $ ./copy2nix.sh -> a. uploads ./awk to nix store
                        b. creates fixed-output-derivtion default.nix

5. nix-build
     prints store path,
     ./result symlink keeps uploaded path alive
