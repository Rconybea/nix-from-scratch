nxfs-tar-0 has builtin support for uncompressing tar archives.
We think we need explicit gzip to help assemble locales

1. PATH should contain
     ~/nixroot/bin

2. ensure PREFIX dir exists
     $ mkdir -p ./gzip

3. build in stage0
     $ (cd stage0 && make compile && make install)

4. copy subtree into store
     $ ./copy2nix.sh -> a. uploads ./gzip to nix store
                        b. creates fixed-output-derivtion default.nix

5. nix-build (to verify fixed-output-derivation working as intended)
     immediately prints the same store path as ./copy2nix.sh
     ./result symlink keeps uploaded path alive
