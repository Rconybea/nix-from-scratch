1. PATH should contain
     ~/nixroot/bin

2. if necessary, edit SSL_CERT_DIR in ./copy2nix.sh

3. copy certificates into store
     $ ./copy2nix.sh -> a. uploads host certificate directory into nix store
                        b. creates fixed-output-derivation default.nix

4. nix-build
     prints store path
     ./result symlinks, preserves uploaded path across GC's
