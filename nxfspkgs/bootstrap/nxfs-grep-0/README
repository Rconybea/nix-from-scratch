We do not need grepsed to demo an working in-store compiler.
However, we do need grep to run an autotools configure script for {sed, ..}

1. PATH should contain
     ~/nixroot/bin

2. ensure PREFIX dir exists
     $ mkdir -p ./sed

3. build in stage0
     $ (cd stage0 && make compile && make install)

4. copy subtree into store
     $ ./copy2nix.sh -> a. uploads ./sed to nix store
                        b. creates fixed-output-derivtion default.nix

5. nix-build (to verify fixed-output-derivation working as intended)
     immediately prints the same store path as ./copy2nix.sh
     ./result symlink keeps uploaded path alive
