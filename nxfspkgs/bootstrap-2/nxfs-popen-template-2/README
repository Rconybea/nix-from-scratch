Provide special versions of posix functions system(), popen(), pclose().

The posix versions don't work from inside nix-build,
because (as required by posix) they hardwire /bin/sh, and ignore PATH.

Use templates here to kitbash sources for programs that rely on the above posix functions,
after expanding template variable:

    @bash_path@ -> /path/to/nix/store/bash

And substitute for posix functions:

    system() -> nxfs_system()
    popen()  -> nxfs_popen()
    pclose() -> nxfs_pclose()

Some packages that rely on these:

    nxfs-popen-2:    expanded to use bash from nxfs-bash-2.
    nxfs-gnumake-2:  use nxfs_system() to implement gnumake $(shell ..) feature
    nxfs-gawk-2:     use nxfs_popen()/nxfs_pclose() to implement awk '|' feature
    nxfs-python-2:   use nxfs_system()/nxfs_popen()/nxfs_pclose() to implement python os wrappers

See also nxfs-gnumake-2, need similar carve-out for gnumake $(shell ...) feature;
but we don't rely on nxfs-popen-template-2 there

We need these features to build nxfs-glibc-stage1-2. This prepares glibc modified to contain
nix-ified system() and popen(), that refer to nix-store bash instead of /bin/sh.

Packages built with nxfs-glibc-stage1-2 are not expected to need the special function versions provided here.
