1. Trying to use native stdenv (see nixpkgs/pkgs/stdenv/native)
   Since nix-bootstrap-replication (mentioned below) not successful.

   Plan:
   - NIX_PREFIX=NIX/PREFIX/value/from/pkgs/nix/Makefile
     (we have $NIX_PREFIX/nixpkgs containing nixpkgs collection)
   - placeholder=/path/to/nix-from-scratch
     (we have add'l packages in $placeholder/nixfromscratchpkgs)
   - set NIX_PATH=$placeholder:$NIX_PREFIX
     (both <nixfromscratchpkgs>, <nixpkgs> should work)

2. Trying to replicate nix bootstrap from (almost) nothing:
   (Lots of apparent progress, but blocked on gnutar)

  nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A make-minimal-bootstrap-sources

  (from regular nix environment)

  Creates a tree under ./result
