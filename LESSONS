1. When you have libc that's not installed to /lib,
   must set linker (patchelf --set-interpreter)
   to the x86_64-ld-linux.so prepared along with that libc.

   Don't expect courteous errors if you get this wrong --
   most likely mysterious segfault.

   Also: a nix-shell that can run outside-the-store bash
   may well also be able to access the dynamic linker in question,
   which interferes with debugging this problem.

   My own path to enlightenment: running
     strace -f nix-build
   in earlier failing version of
     nix-from-scratch/nxfspkgs/nix-pills/example1d,
   happened to notice execve() call returning ENOENT.

   https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html

2. When bootstrapping a toolchain into the nix store,
   need to patchelf to get required dynamic-linker coordination.

   There's a chicken-and-egg problem for
   an executable prepared with an outside-nix-store libc:
   cannot patchelf before you copy into the nix store,
   because that will change the fixed-output-derivation's hash.

   Instead, during initial portion of bootstrap,
   use in-store linker directly.

   For example write
      nix/store/$hash-sysroot/path/to/x86_64-ld-linux.so.2 $executable $args
   instead of
      $executable $args

3. patchelf --set-interpreter

   Not sure why, but patchelf --set-interpreter doesn't work
   (at least for bash)
   when importing into nix store something prepared outside the nix store.
   Even impure build fails. ???

   But prepending ld-linux-x86-64.so does work.  I don't understand this yet.

4. Nix uses different hash presentation in different places.
   (perhaps for historical reasons?).
   For example in nixpkgs generally expected to use sha256 with base32
   presentation.  But nix store paths do something else

5. Use
     $ nix-build --option substitute false

   to suppress binary cache

7. Use
     $ readelf -l path/to/executable-or-library

   to see 'program header table'.  This includes INTERP entry:

     $ readelf -l /home/roland/nixroot/nix/store/f83xlrzbp68xby8imh9d5cdw06a4j3dj-nxfs-wip-1/lib/libc.so.6

8. Typical install assumes either or both of {/bin/sh, /bin/bash} exist.

   This is not the case when nix-builder runs.

   Autotools builds may try to make this configurable via the CONFIG_SHELL variable,
   but don't consistently support it.

   Symptom will be something like
      path/to/foo: cannot execute: required file not found

   where 'foo' is a shell script with a shebang.

   Our workaround is to rewrite the offending script, replacing just the shebang
   with nix-store path to bash.

   For example nxfs-gmp-2 build complained when invoking the 'm4-ccas' script.
   Fix with interplation in nxfs-gmp-2/builder.sh:

     bash_program=${bash}/bin/bash

     chmod -R +w ${src2}
     sed -i "1s:#!.*/bin/sh:#!${bash_program}:" ${src2}/mpn/m4-ccas
     chmod -R -w ${src2}

   EDITORIAL: would like a way to provide this from the nix-build-constructed chroot environment.
   Nix is already chrooting a bunch of directories,  would like to add a couple more.

9. nixcpp build can import an external shell into chroot environment,
   making it appear as /bin/sh. This only works if the imported shell is standalone
   (i.e. statically linked).

   I understand (at least as of 2025) that vanilla nix install gets this from busybox.
   When building nix from source important to enable this feature (it's opt-in).

   In nix-from-scratch we use dash, since that's what busybox uses anyway.

10. nix may silently fallback to a non-sandboxed build.
    Disable in ~/.config/nix/nix.conf:

     sandbox-fallback = false
