```
$ ~/nixroot/bin/nix repl
nix-repl>
```

```
nix-repl> builtins.currentSystem
"x86_64-linux"
```

We can use builtins even though store is empty
```
nix-repl> d = derivation { name = "myname"; builder = "mybuilder"; system = "mysystem"; }
nix-repl> d
<<derivation /home/roland/nixroot/nix/store/61...fq-myname.drv>>
```

Can't build it though
```
nix-repl> :b d
...
error: a 'mysystem' with features {} is required to build
  '/home/roland/nixroot/nix/store/6l1iq144fhp45i5ribj3w28g8m6p6ifq-myname.drv',
but I am a 'x86_64-linux' with features {benchmark, big-parallel, nixos-test, uid-range}
```

From cmdline, could have attempted this with
```
nis-store -r ~/nixroot/nix/store/6l1iq...ifq-myname.drv
```
